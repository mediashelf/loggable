= Loggable

Loggable is a gem that's designed to add a logging interface to classes that don't 
automatically support it.

== Installation

This code is available as a Ruby Gem:

  sudo gem install loggable
  
== Usage

Using the Gem is easy, just include the <tt>loggable</tt> class method in your class 
to enable it:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'logger'
  require 'loggable'
  
  class MyClass
    loggable
  end

Now you can assign a logger instance to this class and have it write log messages to
the specified file:

  MyClass.logger = Logger.new('debug.log')
  
Any class or instance methods now have access to the logger:

  class MyClass
    def self.do_something
      logger.debug 'doing something in the class'
    end
      
    def do_something
      logger.debug 'doing something in an instance'
    end
  end

The above code will write into the log file when called:

  MyClass.do_something
  MyClass.new.do_something

  debug.log:
  
  D, [2008-04-24T20:37:32.273930 #25821] DEBUG -- : doing something in the class
  D, [2008-04-24T20:37:32.274062 #25821] DEBUG -- : doing something in an instance
