= Loggable

Loggable is a gem that's designed to add a logging interface to classes that don't 
automatically support it.

== Installation

This code is available as a Ruby Gem:

  sudo gem install loggable
  
== Usage

Using the Gem is easy, just assign a new logger to your class:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'logger'
  require 'loggable'

  class MyClass; end
  
  MyClass.logger = Logger.new('debug.log')

Now, any class or instance methods have access to the logger:

  class MyClass
    def self.do_something
      logger.debug 'doing something in the class'
    end
      
    def do_something
      logger.debug 'doing something in an instance'
    end
  end

The above code will write into the log file when called:

  MyClass.do_something
  MyClass.new.do_something

  debug.log:
  
  D, [2008-04-24T20:37:32.273930 #25821] DEBUG -- : doing something in the class
  D, [2008-04-24T20:37:32.274062 #25821] DEBUG -- : doing something in an instance

== Removing Logger Functionality

Calling the <tt>logger=</tt> class method to assign a logger to the class will 
trigger the methods necessary to start logging messages.  If you want to turn off 
logging temporarily (without removing the logging statements from your class), 
comment out the line where you assign the new logger.  By default, the logger is
stubbed out, so any calls to methods on it will just return nil.
